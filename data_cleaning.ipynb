There are plenty of restaurant options nearby, and downtown isn't too far. The only thing is the traffic around this area gets a little clogged around rush hour, but I guess that's to be expected.  The mall is nearby, too, if you need some shopping.   Room was good--standard Courtyard. Not as many HD television channels as I would have hoped in 2014. Wireless internet was not terrible.\n",
       "919        Great stuff.  They said they had limited menu selections, but there was a fixed menu option from which you could select an appetizer, entree and dessert.  Everything was delicious.  The portions were a little small, considering it was only 3 courses, I could have had more food; but they weren't unreasonably small.  The pan sear scallop was delicious (but there was only the one) and the lamb was succulent with the extraordinary barolo reduction.  The molten cake I had for dessert was a little too molten for my liking, but still tasty.  I would recommend this place and appreciate all the Yelpers reviews that directed me to it in the first place.  It's definitely worth a trip.    FYI: it's tucked in a shopping center; very unassuming.  Also worth noting -- I was seated next to several peo...\n",
       "943                                    I dined here as a second choice after the wait at a nearby spot was too long. Chuy's was fine, but not particularly memorable. My server was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable about the menu.   I had some enchiladas that are one of the signature dishes due to my server's recommendation. That was an odd choice for me because I generally find enchiladas to be a gooey mess. These had some texture and I liked the chicken inside. I also ordered  guacamole which was good, but not great. Restaurant guac is always overpriced, and unless you must have it, I would pass here, for the price. I thought the salsa with the chips was pretty runny.  So overall, this was fine. I wouldn't go out of my way to visit again, but I wouldn't throw a fit if someone wanted to go here.\n",

So good.   It's a fun and quirky coffee shop, that has delicious chai, what more can you ask for? Maybe a dirty chai, with a shot of espresso?? And pumpkin rolls in June? I'm in! Although I wasn't as into the roll as much as the chai, it's still a solid shop in my book.\n",
       "1260       This place. I cannot stop talking about it. I want to go to there. All. The. Time!  It's such an incredible time! Of course if I lived around town, I don't know if I could afford it! At $39 for a \"cool pass\" entrance it is not cheap. But was it worth it? TOTALLY! The Cool Pass gets you access to everything except for the White Water Rafting.   So what can you do? Well, really, what CAN'T you do! We went zip lining over the white waters, kayaking in the river and went through the rope course. The zip lining is awesome because it's fairly long and high up, but not scary high (for me at least).   The kayaking is super relaxing. It's really just a push off the dock and you're free to kayak wherever. They also offer paddle boarding, which I haven't done, but seems a little more strenuous. I...\n",

Other surprise, it was relatively healthy options too!   I kinda just guessed it would be all fried foods, maybe because it's the south, sorry I'm assuming. I got the Portobello Sandwich with peppers, onions, balsamic on a wheat roll. See, they even upped the ante with a wheat bun! And it was good! The basil green beans were an excellent choice to round out my healthy meal!  Now back to sweating it out on the rope course! Crap, let's sweat out that beer I had too... whoops!\n",

       "2818       Beautiful spot in a beautiful part of town.  Drove by this place a couple of time and I got really curious about it.  This looks like a beautifully restored brick building which may have been an office building at one time.  Downstairs is appears to be more of a bar type area where drinking rules.  There is a second story where it appears to be more of a dining area.  There is also an outdoor patio area which really looks with about 10 tables which really looks like a nice place.  Ate on the second floor dining area.  The decor is pretty much the basic Irish Pub look, dark wood bootsh, wood floorks, kind of a dark atmosphere that was brightened by sunlight shining through the windows.  The menu is very basic barfood with an irish slant to it.  My freind had fish and chips and I had a c...\n",

The bedding and rooms @ Marriott are comfy and clean.  My biggest gripe w this Marriott is with the scent that is used.  The scent is in the hallways and in the rooms.

I love the Carolina style BBQ with the vinegar flavors.  I tried the sampler and split it with my husband.  We tried the beef brisket, the sausage, the pulled pork, and the chicken.  My favorite was the pulled pork.  The chicken had a mayo looking dressing which I was not feeling so I recommend doubling on the pulled pork because you get 4 meat options on the sampler.  the sampler also includes 2 side orders.  We selected the collard greens and the BBQ beans both excellent!  Seriously love me some Carolina BBQ!!!  Be prepared to wait in line here...it's worth it.\n",

Wine selection was Good not great! I am Italian and was raised drinking wine from glasses from the pantry.  When I'm in public and spend 20 on a glass I prefer a wine glass not a glass from the pantry. I understand its supposed to be Tuscan style but there should be a choice of steam ware.   Ambiance was good.   Service was ok  I'll be back to eat for sure.\n",

       "1568824    Upon entering, the patio is incredible!  I Once the temperature warms up, that will be one serious hot spot.  It's all set in a gorgeous 1920's villa, and it visually does not disappoint.  The music was slightly a buzz kill (Shaggy, Blink 182 , Smash Mouth, and other 90's songs..) but I'm hoping they'll work out the kink on that one.  The staff was very welcoming and friendly, happy to suggest items from the menu.  The items on the menu are all named from lines from movies, which is really fun!  Food was great - Wonderful chili queso, tacos are priced between $3-$4, sides additional, and I thought $9 for a small bowl of chili was a little steep.  They offer a very eclectic cocktail menu and frozen margaritas which is also a nice addition.  Overall, great place!  I knocked off a star fo...\n",

Inside, the bar and dining area is very nice, but the outdoor patio area was even nicer. Decent amount of space heaters, outside bar, and a few TVs. I was a little disappointed with the food. Unlike most Mexican restaurants, you have to order chips and salsa. We ordered chips and queso, which was just OK. The chips were great, but the queso was luke warm at best. I also ordered the organic rice bowl, which wasn't bad, but similar to one at Chipotle ($2 less). Overall, this is a great place to hang out and have a drink with decent food.\n",

       "1568829    We had a group of 12 at RuRu's for dinner on a Friday night. I called the day of to make a reservation. We got there early, so we could try the cocktails. The margarita is good, but small for $9.50. Unfortunately, it was raining and the outdoor bar was not open. The outdoor space is great with heaters, TVs and a large bar.  The hostess took us to our table, which she was helping setup. The table was set for 10 people. I told her we had 12 and her response was \"ok\". She disappeared and never returned. We squeezed 12 at our table until the 2 top next to us closed out. Our waiter asked if we wanted to order appetizers but none of us had menus. It took 2 times asking and another 20 minutes to get a diet coke. The food was so-so and the service slow and confused.  But the worst part is the ...\n",
       "1568830    Over Christmas Break, four friends and I wanted to have dinner at RuRu's. Given the holidays and the size of our party, I decided to make a reservation about 2 weeks in advance.  On making a reservation: No Open Table. You need to call.  On the atmosphere: Maybe it was because of the holidays, maybe because it's a new hot spot in Myers Park - the place was packed. Good thing I made a reservation. The patio is going to be fabulous in the spring...and maybe even give Selwyn a run for it's money.  On the drinks: Three of my friends got margaritas, and they all said the margs were on the sweet side. I really enjoy the smokiness of mezcal, so I opted for the \"I Love the Smell of Napalm\". The drink was perfectly balanced - the rosemary syrup did not overpower.  On the food: Very funny dish n...\n",

I liked, hot loved, my pulled pork, but really enjoyed the creamy man-and-cheese and sweet potato waffle fries. They killed it on the sides. Also came with a jalapeÃ±o corn bread slice. They also have 6 different sauces so I poured it on.  Will be back, I want to try that pulled chicken my wife is raving about. I did improper things to that macaroni though.\n",

If you are going to charge $4.00 more for the brisket,  it should be very apparent on the menu not buried in fine print at the top of menu.  Which because of the low lighting at night was impossible to read.   Brisket-- I have had a lot better,  not worth the extra $4.00.    Not sure what other meats other than the pulled pork were available on the Cotswald Plate.   Mac& Cheese -- gritty.   The homemade house chips were almost burnt.   Cornbread Fritters???   It was almost like a cookie  -- no taste -  certainly not like you would expect for Cornbread.  Service-- our waitress was snippy and almost rude.   Greens - OK again I have had a lot better.  Slaw again just OK.\n",

       "1569124    Have eaten here twice and both times were a big disappointment. First time was for shrimp and fries - standard deep fried stuff and nothing special. I tried again and had the pulled pork with two sides - mac & cheese and the greens. The greens were the best thing on the plate which has to be one of the most disappointing statements one could make. The mac and cheese was dry and as bland as anything. The pulled pork was a disaster. The appearance should have been warning enough - unappetizing looking slop. The taste? I am sure there was pork in there as I got a very faint hint of smokiness from time to time. However, other than a somewhat stringy texture amongst the overwhelming flavor of sugar it could have been anything. Did I mention the overly sweet sugar taste? That was all you got...\n",
       "1569144    My wife disagrees with the two star rating thinking it should only get one.  My thinking is: 1 for good service and one for cleanliness.  Even though the vibe (decor and music) is mid-nineties, it's well done.  The positive remarks end there unfortunately.  We ordered the Mediterranean Board for an appetizer and split the burger.  The fries (although greasy) and the hummus wasn't bad, but the taziki, chicken and beef skewers lacked any sort of Mediterranean flavor whatsoever.  They must have been out of salt and lemon because I've never had anything so bland before.  The meat was overdone, charred and had too much gristle.  No where near restaurant quality in my humble opinion.  The burger was sloppy and barely edible.  Bad meat? I'm not sure, but we both had stomachaches after the mea...\n",

       "1569151    Well I took a chance on this place after reading a couple of review.   This place was awful and a rip-off.  I ordered the fried fish plate with cabbage and mashed potatoes and gravy for a total of $10.60 including tax.    For starters they only gave me one small piece of what looked like fried tilapia from the frozen section of Walmart.   It was TINY.  For 10 dollars they could at least put two or three pieces of fish in the plate.  I think Shomars nearby has better fish than this and they give you a lot of fish for less.  Now the cabbage was okay but the mashed potatoes were horrible.  They tasted like over-salted boxed mashed potatoes that were old and sitting up all day.    Overall the food was below expectations and not good at all.  Especially for the price.  They could have added...\n",

As soon as you step foot in Cachet Nails, you're warmly greeted by smiling faces, amazing upscale decor including pretty cool artwork and rhinestone chairs, cleanliness, music and refreshments. No one yells at you from across the salon like other nail salons we have all visited! The nail polish selection is beyond expectation and everyone there is more than happy to help select the perfect shade for you.   I had the pleasure of having services by Cindy and Julie. I even brought my mom one day and Van did an awesome job on her pedicure. These ladies are amazing, great to talk to and efficient!  Trinity, the owner, is by far the most amazing person ever!

What we ended up getting was a deluxe package.  He is not a typical guy who likes these excursions and to hear him commented on how much he enjoyed Cachet Nail Boutique was music to my ears.  We were greeted warmly and happily by Trinity, the owner, and her nail techs.  We were invited to enjoy complementary drinks as we discussed what we'd like done.  I had a mimosa and my husband opted for a glass of wine.  The mimosa was delicious and hubby said the wine was good wine.

To top it off, the food is amazing too. Wagyu beef tataki, tuna sashimi, and the poke are my favorites, but everything I tried was unique and delicious. Great staff and overall excellent service.

I expected this to be more of a takeout place, but it is definitely more of an eat-in experience. We ordered  a Hibachi chicken meal, and some sushi rolls (Alaska and Tuna) The hibachi came with a salad, soup and choice of several sides. The salads came out, and almost immediately the soup and our main courses were brought to the table. The timing could use some improvement. The sushi was very good and the texture was better than most local places. We will definitely be back!\n",
